    <p>This strawberry matcha latte is a refreshing ice-cold latte and went viral on social media. It’s so simple to make at home and much more budget-friendly than Starbucks. The earthy matcha tea flavor is the perfect partner to the sweet strawberries.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1/3 cup finely chopped fresh strawberries (about 4 to 5 strawberries)</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon white sugar, or to taste</li>
        <li>1/4 cup boiling water</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon matcha green tea powder</li>
        <li>ice as needed</li>
        <li>1/2 cup unsweetened vanilla almond milk, or milk of your choice</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Directions:</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Combine strawberries and sugar in a small bowl. Use a fork to lightly crush and mix (or use a muddler), and spoon into a glass.</li>
        <li>Whisk boiling water and matcha powder in a bowl or cup until well combined and smooth; set aside.</li>
        <li>Top crushed strawberries with a handful of ice. Slowly pour milk on top of the strawberry-ice mixture, followed by matcha. Stir and serve with a wide straw.</li>
    </ol>

    <h3><em>Note:</em></h3>
    <p><em>The amount of sugar is dependent on the sweetness of the berries, as well as your personal taste preference. If you’d like the latte to have a stronger matcha flavor, just use more of the powder.</em></p>
